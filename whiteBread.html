        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ ounces active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 tbsp. white sugar</li>
            <li>2½ cups warm water (110F° / 45C°)</li>
            <li>6½ cups bread flour</li>
            <li>3 tbsp. lard, softened</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a large bowl. Stir in 2 cups flour, lard, 
                and salt. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition.
                 When the dough comes together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until 
                 smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover 
                with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.</li>
            <li>Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two 
                equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into the prepared pans, cover with a damp 
                cloth, and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place bread in the preheated oven and lower 
                the temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake until the top is golden brown and the 
                bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
