        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 cups lukewarm water</li>
            <li>2 tsp. yeast</li>
            <li>2 tsp. salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>The night before, combine all ingredients together. First mix the dry 
                ingredients together and then add water. Mix the ingredients until the 
                dough comes together. Cover it with a plastic wrap and let it sit for 
                12-20 hours on the countertop.</li>
            <li>The following day, the dough should be wet, sticky and bubbly. Generously 
                flour your hands and the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Take the dough (if it sticks, apply more flour to your hands) and form a 
                baguette shape. You will easily get atleast 2-3 baguettes. Place it on a baking sheet and 
                sprinkle a generous amount of flour on it. Score the top with a sharp knife 
                and cover it with a towel. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 Â°F. You will need to have 2 shelves in an oven. Fill a deep 
                baking pan with 2 cups of hot boiled water, and place it on the lower rack, inside 
                your oven. This will make the bread crispy on the outside. Place the bread on the middle 
                rack. Remove water from the oven after 10 minutes. Keep on baking the bread for another 
                30 minutes or until golden crispy brown.</li>
        </ol>
